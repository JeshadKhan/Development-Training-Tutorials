<h2><u> Computer programming </u></h2>

<p2> Computer programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. 
This source code is written in one or more programming languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, Smalltalk, etc.). The purpose of programming 
is to create a set of instructions that computers use to perform specific operations or to exhibit desired behaviors. The process of writing 
source code often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic.
Within software engineering, programming (the implementation) is regarded as one phase in a software development process.
There is an ongoing debate on the extent to which the writing of programs is an art form, a craft, or an engineering discipline.
However, representing oneself as a "Professional Software Engineer" without a license from an accredited institution is illegal in many parts of the world. </p2>
